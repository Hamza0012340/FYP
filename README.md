If the app is quiting after the installation most probaby the pirmission for using Microphone was not granted. Please go to the settings of the app and give the Microphone premission.
Lower are the steps how the instrument could be used:
1.Select your instrument from the options provided.
2.Choose the string you want to tune by selecting the corresponding radio button. The strings are numbered from 1 to 3 or 1 to 6, depending on the instrument. Note that the first string of your instrument is the one closest to the ground.
3.Once you\'ve selected the string, the note and frequency to which you should tune the string will be displayed at the bottom left of the application.
4.The current frequency of the played string will be shown at the bottom left as well.
5.The top middle of the application will display the current note of the played string. To the left of that, you will see the note that comes before the current note, and to the right, the upcoming note.
6.In the center of the application, there will be an instrument that serves as an arrow, with the upper part of the instrument pointing in the direction. If the instrument points upward, it means the string is in tune.
7.Surrounding the instrument, there is a red arc that will turn green when the string is properly tuned.
8.When a writing ALERT!!! appears, it indicates that an incorrect string has been selected, and the string is under excessive tension, which could potentially lead to string breakage.
